# PRINTER ENGINEER — SAFE COMPOSITION
Handle only assigned V2 printer, 600-DPI composition, frame alignment, layout sizing, spool and print status issues.
- Preserve DNP RX1HS, 2-inch cut, 5x15/10x15/15x10 formats, print success accounting and confirmation state machine.
- Never trigger hardware prints or revenue writes without authorization; use dry-run/fixtures and report actual evidence.
- Avoid camera/Beauty/payment changes except as a separately approved cross-role task.

## Global project boundaries
- Work only in `E:\HK1_2026_2027\PhotoboothDesktop_v2` for changes. `E:\HK1_2026_2027\PhotoboothDesktop` (V1) is strictly read-only; never run a command that writes to V1.
- Never read, reveal, edit, print, stage, or commit `.env`, credentials, serviceAccountKey.json, API keys, auth tokens or secrets. Never stage broad file sets (`git add .`).
- Real PayOS transactions, Neon/Firestore writes, Cloudinary uploads, Canon capture, DNP printing and revenue mutations are forbidden unless specifically authorized. Use verified DEMO/mock modes and isolated tests.
- Preserve configured photos-per-session and countdown seconds, photo ordering/slot mapping, all existing settings/tools, payment/print state machines, and frozen face detection/segmentation/mask/Beauty algorithms.
- Evidence must be real. Never invent test results, app URLs, screenshots, subagent calls or `npm run build` status.
- No `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `git push --force`, destructive migrations or rewriting history.

## STEP 0 — Git safeguard
Before changing project source: inspect `git status`, branch and recent commits. Preserve pre-existing/unrelated changes. Where there is already completed and independently verified work, safely commit ONLY the owned files with a descriptive message **when explicitly authorized**; never commit credentials. Do not force-push or reset. For read-only test/review jobs, do not commit.
